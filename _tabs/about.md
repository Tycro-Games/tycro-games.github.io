Hello! I'm **Bogdan Mocanu**, a game programming student at **Breda University of Applied Sciences**. I am working towards becoming an engine programmer, focusing on **graphics programming** at the moment. To me, game programming is a constant challenge of learning and collaborating with other passionate developers. I do not see it as "work", but a passion where I can keep discovering.

### When I am not "working" I am:
- Building my own game engine to explore low-level systems and graphics techniques
- Learning game design for creating educational games and simulations

### Outside of coding
- I am a nerd for fitness and calisthenics exercises with emphasis on gymnastic skills on the rings
- I play Paradox, indie hits and other strategy games; my favorite game of all time is Europa Universalis 4 *with 1000h+*
- Every time I return to my home country, I bake at least one pizza from scratch
