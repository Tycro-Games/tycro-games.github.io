Hello! I'm **Bogdan Mocanu**, a game programming student at **Breda University of Applied Sciences**. I am working towards becoming an engine programmer, focusing on **graphics programming** at the moment. To me, game programming is a constant challenge of learning and collaborating with other passionate developers. I do not see it as "work", but a wide subject where I can keep discovering.

### Outside of "work"

- I am building my **own game engine** to explore low-level systems and graphics techniques
- I learning **game design** for creating **serious** games and **simulations**
- I am practicing calisthenics exercises with emphasis on gymnastic skills on the rings
- I play Paradox, indie and **strategy games**; my favorite game of all time is **Europa Universalis 4** *with 1000h+*
- Every time I return to my home country, I **bake** at least one **pizza** from scratch
