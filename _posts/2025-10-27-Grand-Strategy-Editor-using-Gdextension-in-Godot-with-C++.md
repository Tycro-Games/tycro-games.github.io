## Intro

ADD HOOK here:
Ideas:

- Importance of grand strategy tools to make it easier for game developerms to make games in that genre
- Maybe some highlight of the project, like rendering, borders? Inspector for editing data?

Border generation grand strategy games may be one of the most interestingly complicated subjects that I approached so far. I started this project around the time that Paradox was already posting videos with the new content of Europa Universalis 5 (EU5). Below are references I used from Paradox games:

*From left to right: Europa Universalis 5 (EU5), Victoria 3 and EU4*

> The image from EU4 is using a mod for graphics enhancement.

I believe the most peculiar aspect is that Grand Strategy Games always have a runtime component, the maps you see above will change drastically over the course of one game and it will differ dramatically between runs.
I own Europa Universalis 4, therefore, it is not surprising that it will have similarities with the rightmost render. EU4 uses a `province map` to keep track of each province, I am not entirely certain, but I believe that they use the map below to generate their borders:
