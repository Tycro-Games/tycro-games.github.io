## 📂 Source Code
The game source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tycro-Games/Lunar-Voyage).


## 🚀 About the Project
Lunar Voyage features enemies that dynamically adjust their paths based on tower placements. It is a game that I worked in my spare time, during highschool. I was responsible for all the code used in the project.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed
- **Unity**: Designed and implemented interconnected systems in Unity with clean and modular architecture.
- **AI and Pathfinding Systems**: Integrated the A* algorithm to enable dynamic enemy navigation.
- **Game Prototyping**: Built a functional prototype combining pathfinding mechanics with tower defense gameplay.
- **Gameplay Tools**: Developed tools for procedural wave spawning using scriptable objects and customizable projectile movement.
- **FMOD**: Gained experience integrating FMOD.

## ⚙️ My Contributions

### Dynamic Pathfinding
Enemies dynamically alter their routes based on player tower placement.

*Enemies recalculate their path when towers are placed, finding the optimal route around obstacles*

### Procedural Wave Spawning
Procedurally selects enemies from a pool using scriptable objects and weight-based values.

*Projectile explosion mechanics with area-of-effect damage*

### Tower Placement and Projectile Mechanics
Towers shoot projectiles with customizable speed and parabolic paths.
