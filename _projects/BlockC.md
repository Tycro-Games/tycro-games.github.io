## 🎓 About the Block

This project was part of my university curriculum, where the goal was to implement a raytracing engine in 8 weeks using the provided [template](https://github.com/jbikker/voxpopuli), focusing on voxel-based rendering. I designed and developed the core raytracing algorithm, which runs entirely on the CPU, allowing it to simulate lighting effects like shadows, reflections, and refractions.

The project served as my introduction into graphics programming.

## 📂 Source Code & Template

The game is based on a template I received during the block, which you can find [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Tycro-Games/Raytracer-VoxPopuli).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++**: Developed core game logic and the raytracing algorithm.
- **GLFW**: Managed graphics rendering, window handling, and input events to streamline the interface.
- **ImGui**: Used to create an user interface for real-time control over raytracing parameters like light intensity and reflection settings.

### **Area Lighting for Soft Shadows**

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
  <div style="flex: 1; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; align-items: center;">
    Created area lights that cast realistic shadows based on the light source’s size and distance.

- **Optimization Techniques**: Optimized the raytracing algorithm with:
  - **Multithreading**: Using multithreading to distribute ray calculations across multiple CPU cores.
  - **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: Applied SIMD instructions to process multiple rays simultaneously, increasing speed.
