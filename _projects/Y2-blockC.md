## 🎓 About the Project

FireAnt is a cross-platform engine, with **Nintendo** and **PC**. It was made to create strategy game in a team of 7 programmers, over 8 weeks. I focused on **graphics programming** and on the **cross-platform API** for Nintendo.

## 📂 Source Code

Unfortunately, due to NDA restrictions, I am unable to share the codebase.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Designed and implemented the rendering layer, ensuring compatibility across Nintendo and PC targets. Contributed to the overall engine architecture with a focus on abstraction and maintainability.

- **Core Engine Systems**: Worked within an ECS architecture using [`entt`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) and [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) for serialization. I built core gameplay systems, including a particle system and a 2D unit animation system, enabling other developers to easily integrate effects and animated sprites into the game.

- **Engine Inspector UI**: Utilized [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to create editor windows for managing game entities, resources, and scene data.
- **Teamwork**: As this was my first "large" collaborative engine project, I contributed to code reviews, helped enforce team coding standards through using Github Actions, and worked to maintain a shared vision across the team.
