# An Unrealistic Spaceship Simulator (AUSS) 🚀
**Created for Breda University Intake (Creative Media & Game Technologies)**

**AUSS** is a **top-down shooter** developed for my **Breda University** intake, using **C++** and **SDL2**. The project embraces the theme **"Bounce"**, where the core mechanic revolves around shooting projectiles that reflect on the tiles in the level.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **C++**: Game logic and core programming
- **SDL2**: Graphics, window management, and input handling

## 🎓 About the Intake

The **Creative Media & Game Technologies** program at **Breda University of Applied Sciences** has a selective admission process, where applicants showcase their skills through a hands-on project. The "Bounce" theme challenged me to combine creative thinking with technical development.


## ⚙️ Key Highlights:
- **Wave System**: The game is structured in **waves of enemies**. Players need to clear the current wave to move to the next, and the game progressively becomes more challenging. The **enemy spawner** becomes increasingly difficult with each wave. 
- **Flexible Enemy Configuration**: One of the unique aspects of this project is that **players** can modify the game's **enemy waves** and **enemy properties** (such as health, speed, damage) simply by editing the JSON files. No programming experience is required, making it accessible for creative customization.
- **Bounce Mechanic and Collision Handling Using a Sweep and Prune Algorithm**
- **Built in C++ & SDL2**: A showcase of my ability to work with industry-standard programming languages and libraries.
