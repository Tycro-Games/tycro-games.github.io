## 📂 Source Code

Unfortunately, due to NDA restrictions, I am unable to share the codebase.

## 🎓 About the Project

This project was created by a team of 12 students (9 programmers and 3 artists). Without a dedicated designer, I stepped up as a first time producer—leading meetings, resolving conflicts, managing releases, and supporting workflow improvements.

## 📋 Producer Experience & Reflections

- Used Scrum methodology to run team meetings, track progress, and manage tasks/risks.
- Gave project updates to the team and handled itch.io releases with release notes.
- Helped sort out team conflicts.
- Learned how our choice of tools affected teamwork and version control.
- Emphasized peer reviews to boost team cohesion and morale.
- Found planning and managing scope pretty tough, but learned a lot from it.
- Balanced coding with leading the team, gaining valuable experience for future lead or indie projects.

## 💻 Technical Contributions

Although I focused mostly on production, I also contributed as a developer—mainly on bug fixes and in-engine usability tools.
