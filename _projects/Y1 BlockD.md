## 🎓 About the Project

This project was made in a team of 12 students(4 programmers, 3 designers and 5 artists). I focused on creating a **procedural coastline generation tool** for artists and designers.

The tool was developed using **C++** and integrated into **Unreal Engine**. The initial prototype was built in **Unity**.

## 📂 Source Code

This project was hosted on **Perforce** as part of a collaborative workflow, and the source code is not publicly available.

## 🛠️ Skills Developed

- **C++ Development**: Implemented the tool’s core logic and Unreal Engine integration.  
- **Agile Methodology**: Worked iteratively in a team, conducting regular stand-ups and sprints.  
- **Collaboration**: Coordinated with designers and artists to align tool functionality with creative goals.  
- **Research Skills**: Studied Wave Function Collapse algorithm and implementations to establish feasibility of the tool.  
- **Prototyping**: Built the initial tool prototype in Unity for rapid testing and feedback.  
- **Unreal Engine Workflow**: Integrated C++ tools into Unreal Engine and ensured usability for non-programmers.

## ⚙️ Key Highlights

### **Tile-Based Input for Procedural Generation**

I initially tried using the 2D tile editor in Unreal Engine, but I found [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to be much more efficient for the designers and artists.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
  <div style="flex: 1; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; align-items: center;">
    The tool uses a .tmx file specifying tile types. The system dynamically generates the coastline and mainland tiles that fit together based on the their user defined sockets.

<!-- Add the images showing the results of editing the text file in Tiled and how it shows in the engine -->

### **Constraint-Based Tile Placement**

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
  <div style="flex: 1; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; align-items: center;">
    Designed a WFC algorithm that enables defining 3D tiles and their connections with other tiles using sockets. It also generates all the sockets for rotated tiles if the user enables that setting.

### **A* Pathfinding for Road Generation**

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; gap: 20px;">
  <div style="flex: 1; font-size: 1.5em; display: flex; align-items: center;">
    Incorporated an A* pathfinding algorithm to generate roads between specified points. The algorithm avoids obstacle objects, ensuring that roads go around the island's gameplay objectives or props.

## 🎥 Watch the Trailer

In addition to creating the procedural tool, I also created the trailer for this project.
